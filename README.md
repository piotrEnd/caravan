My friend sells used caravans. Here it is a landing page in retro-nostalgic-style for him... And for me it was an exercise in using:
* Sass with SCSS syntax
* BEM-methodology for naming classes
* npm for automations

Webpage is responsive:
* fluid grid adapts to current used viewport
* CSS images are optimized for different widths
* styles change on breakpoints
