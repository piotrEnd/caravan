**Information architecture and design:**

Caravaning is a style of living, often associated with youthful years. To have a caravan means to be self-suffient and freewheeling at the same time. Landing page for salesman with heart of craftsman trying to expand his business. Retro-nostalgic style mixed with compact offer message and thus pretty straightforward.

Exercise in using:
* Sass with SCSS syntax
* BEM-methodology for naming classes
* npm for automations

Webpage is responsive:
* fluid grid adapts to current used viewport
* CSS images are optimized for different widths
* styles change on breakpoints
