Caravaning embodies a lifestyle often linked to carefree youthful years, representing a blend of self-sufficiency and carefree spontaneity. It's a landing page of a salesman with the heart of a craftsman, driven to expand his business.

**Information architecture:**

The design combines a retro-nostalgic aesthetic with a succinct and direct offer. Images and a responsive grid dynamically adjust to the user's viewport. The Lato font carries a hint of friendliness while maintaining a professional demeanour.
